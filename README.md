# Common Actions and Workflows
This repo contains common actions and workflows for the Lido applications

## Workflows

- [`verify-commit-signatures.yml`](.github/actions/verify-commit-signatures/README.md)

### `prepare-release-draft.yml`
This workflow creates or updates a release draft for the current application version. 
It should be triggered on a push to the `main` (or your variant) branch.
Example:
```yaml
name: Prepare release draft
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  prepare-release-draft:
    uses: lidofinance/actions/.github/workflows/prepare-release-draft.yml@main
```

### `k8s-build-push-harbor.yml`

This reusable workflow builds a Docker image and pushes it to Harbor.

It is intended to be called from application repositories via `jobs.<job_id>.uses`.

The workflow performs:

- Docker Buildx setup
- Harbor login
- Docker image build
- Docker image push
- OCI image labels generation
- GitHub Actions cache usage

#### Inputs

| Name | Required | Description | Default |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `tag` | yes | Image tag to push | - |
| `registry` | yes | Harbor registry host | - |
| `registry_username` | yes | Harbor username | - |
| `image` | yes | Image path in Harbor, for example `<harbor-project>/<application-name>` | - |
| `environment` | yes | GitHub Environment name used for approvals, vars and secrets | - |
| `build_context` | no | Docker build context | `.` |
| `dockerfile` | no | Dockerfile path | `Dockerfile` |

#### Secrets

| Name | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `registry_token` | yes | Harbor password or robot token |

### Usage examples

#### Production image

Manual build and push of a release image.

```yaml
name: Build and push <your application name> to <env name>

run-name: Build and push <your application name>:${{ inputs.TAG }} to <env name>

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      TAG:
        description: Image tag to push
        required: true
        type: string

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    if: github.ref_name == '<release branch name>'
    uses: lidofinance/actions/.github/workflows/k8s-build-push-harbor.yml@main
    with:
      tag: ${{ inputs.TAG }}
      registry: registry.prod.k8s-prod.org
      registry_username: ${{ vars.REGISTRY_PROD_USERNAME }}
      image: <harbor-project>/<application-name>
      environment: <github-environment-name>
    secrets:
      registry_token: ${{ secrets.HARBOR_TOKEN }}
```

#### Staging image

Builds and pushes a staging image on every push to the `main` branch.

```yaml
name: Build and push <your application name> to staging

run-name: Build and push <your application name>:staging

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths-ignore:
      - '.github/**'
      - 'test/**'

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    uses: lidofinance/actions/.github/workflows/k8s-build-push-harbor.yml@main
    with:
      tag: staging-${{ github.sha }}
      registry: registry.staging.k8s-staging.org
      registry_username: ${{ vars.REGISTRY_STAGING_USERNAME }}
      image: <harbor-project>/<application-name>
      environment: <staging-github-environment-name>
    secrets:
      registry_token: ${{ secrets.HARBOR_TOKEN }}
```

#### Development image

Builds and pushes a development image on every push to the `develop` branch.

```yaml
name: Build and push <your application name> to dev

run-name: Build and push <your application name>:dev

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop
    paths-ignore:
      - '.github/**'
      - 'test/**'

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    uses: lidofinance/actions/.github/workflows/k8s-build-push-harbor.yml@main
    with:
      tag: dev
      registry: registry.dev.k8s-dev.org
      registry_username: ${{ vars.REGISTRY_DEVEL_USERNAME }}
      image: <harbor-project>/<application-name>
      environment: <dev-github-environment-name>
    secrets:
      registry_token: ${{ secrets.HARBOR_TOKEN }}
```

### Notes

For development and staging environments it is common to use mutable tags such as `dev` and `staging`. Each successful build updates the corresponding image.

For production releases, use immutable version tags (for example `1.15.0` or `v1.15.0`) to ensure reproducible deployments.

Prefer pinning reusable workflow versions to a release tag (for example `@v1`) once the workflow API is stable.

## Actions

### `validate-inputs`

Validates GitHub workflow inputs against a safe character allowlist.

This action is useful for reusable workflows that receive user-controlled inputs and later pass them to shell commands, Docker build arguments, labels, tags, or deployment workflows.

The action expects workflow inputs serialized as JSON.

Example:

```yaml
- name: Validate inputs
  uses: lidofinance/actions/.github/actions/validate-inputs@<full-commit-sha>
  with:
    inputs: ${{ toJSON(inputs) }}
```

For pull request testing, use the feature branch instead of `main` until the action is merged:

```yaml
- name: Validate inputs
  uses: lidofinance/actions/.github/actions/validate-inputs@<full-commit-sha>
  with:
    inputs: ${{ toJSON(inputs) }}
```

#### Example in a reusable workflow

```yaml
name: Example reusable workflow

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      tag:
        required: true
        type: string
      image:
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Validate inputs
        uses: lidofinance/actions/.github/actions/validate-inputs@<full-commit-sha>
        with:
          inputs: ${{ toJSON(inputs) }}
```

#### Allowed characters

The current validation pattern is:

```text
^[\d\w.,\-/]+$
```

Allowed characters include letters, numbers, underscore, dot, comma, dash and slash.

Inputs containing shell metacharacters such as quotes, semicolons, dollar signs, spaces, or command substitutions will be rejected.

For security and reproducibility, pin reusable workflows and actions to a full commit SHA instead of a mutable branch or tag.
